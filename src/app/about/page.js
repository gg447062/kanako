          Kanako Wynkoop was born in 1975, in Sasebo, Nagasaki Prefecture,
          Japan. She moved to the U.S. in 1982. In 1994, Wynkoop moved to
          Olympia, Washington, where she remains an active member of an
          internationally recognized artistic community. In 1995 she opened a
          vintage clothing store named Dumpster Values. In 1999, she began
          making films, notably the feature 9 Weeks, which documents the arts
          community in Olympia. This film exemplifies her mission to create
          films and other artistic works that span genres and give voice to
          those who have been historically left out of the mainstream media. In
          2016 Wynkoop was accepted into Bela Tarr’s Film Factory in Sarajevo,
          Bosnia Herzegovina. She is the recipient of grants from the Art
          Matters Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the
          Soroptimist Society. Her films have won awards at the Sicilia Queer
          Film Festival, the National Gallery of Canada’s Showcase of World’s
          Best Shorts, and the Judge’s Award at the 37th Northwest Film & Video
          Festival, among others. Her work has screened at the Q Film Festival
          in Jakarta, International Short Film Festival Oberhausen in Germany,
          the Paris GLBT Film Festival, SXSW and dozens more. From 2009-2015 she
          did extensive tours of the U.S. and Europe with various live
          multimedia musical performances, playing drums, bass, and singing
          original work. In addition to showing her own work, Wynkoop is a
          community-minded artist who owns and curates a performance space in
          Olympia known for hosting bands and musicians from all over the world;
          often showcasing artists that fly under-the-radar of even the most
          underground music scenes.

          After a period of experimentation and research into the theory and
          practice of filmmaking, with no formal training, I began making
          completed video works in 1999. One major accomplishment from that time
          is the crux of my larger mission. 9 Weeks is a feature length
          documentary about the punk and activist scene of Olympia, Washington:
          my community. Behind the camera, I had the unique experience of being
          both within and apart from my everyday world, from my peers. This
          threw my own work into relief, and it became a subject unto itself,
          separate from me. The film followed people I know, friends,
          contemporaries—Carrie Brownstein, Calvin Johnson, Nikki McClure, Joe
          Preston, Mirah, Tae Won Yu, Nomy Lamm, Zack Carlson—many of us women,
          some of us identifying as queer, most of us from working class or poor
          backgrounds, making art because of or despite these facts. The film
          was the culmination of my early forays into film; its content a
          springboard for what was to come.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.p}>
          After 9 Weeks, I continued my self-styled education, and in the
          process found several mentors. Three female filmmakers—Sara Gomez,
          Agnas Varda, Chantal Akerman—loom large in my canon of influence.
          Their non-linear, unusually paced and either oblique or dead-on
          approaches drive me to occupy my own meaningful space in the male
          dominated medium of film; to enter into dialogue with these women and
          their work. Technique-wise, I have referenced the work of Bela Tarr,
          Yasujiro Ozo, and earlier work of Aki Kaurismäki. Similar to these
          artists, I have made work that allows the audience time and space to
          consider the ideas and images I present in my films, as opposed to
          being bombarded with visual and audio cues that explain what is
          happening in a fixed way. This effect is achieved by—but not limited
          to—deliberate pacing, calculated and sparse use of dialogue, grounded
          camera, and a long depth of field. A static artistic vantage creates
          an active audience, a spectrum of experience where each viewer is
          given the opportunity to follow his or her own internal process to
          develop a personal relationship with the work. Ideally, this
          relationship is one that translates beyond the theater or screening
          room, a connection leading to greater empathy, which can be a powerful
          step towards shifting social consciousness, a goal that emerged
          alongside my process, one that revealed itself through my approach to
          my subject matter as I learned to recognize and hone my own
          perspectives.

          It was through the work of Rainer Werner Fassbinder that I first
          recognized the power that lies in the union of artistic and social
          values. Of particular resonance is the film Ali: Fear Eats the Soul,
          the story of an interracial relationship born out of the need not only
          for companionship, but for survival, economic and otherwise. As the
          product of a similar marriage, my own identity and place in the world
          had always been difficult to navigate. Despite claims of openness to
          intersections and multi-culturalism within the communities I reside,
          there is no easy place for muddled identities. Ali changed that for
          me, and I was compelled to find and create my own representations of
          complex identities, those who either cannot, or choose not to succumb
          to the status quo—lives in resistance.{' '}

        <p className={styles.p}>
          Synthesizing these disparate influences in my filmmaking has taken
          years of artistic exploration and technical research. My daily work
          includes writing treatments, shooting and editing my own movies as
          well as steadily viewing films and reading film-related texts. Whether
          it’s a book on editing, camera operation, film histories, or theory
          like Sculpting In Time by Andrey Tarkovsky, I am constantly engaged in
          the process of filtering and channeling new and old ideas to create
          innovative cinema of populations that are often ignored or made
          one-dimensional by the Hollywood aesthetic.
