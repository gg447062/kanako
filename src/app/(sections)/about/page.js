      <h3>Biography: </h3>
      <p>
        Kanako Wynkoop was born in 1975, in Sasebo, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan.
        She moved to the U.S. in 1982. In 1994, Wynkoop moved to Olympia,
        Washington, where she remains an active member of an internationally
        recognized artistic community. In 1995 she opened a vintage clothing
        store named Dumpster Values. In 1999, she began making films, notably
        the feature 9 Weeks, which documents the arts community in Olympia. This
        film exemplifies her mission to create films and other artistic works
        that span genres and give voice to those who have been historically left
        out of the mainstream media. In 2016 Wynkoop was accepted into Bela
        Tarr’s Film Factory in Sarajevo, Bosnia Herzegovina. She is the
        recipient of grants from the Art Matters Foundation, the Bill and
        Melinda Gates Foundation and the Soroptimist Society. Her films have won
        awards at the Sicilia Queer Film Festival, the National Gallery of
        Canada’s Showcase of World’s Best Shorts, and the Judge’s Award at the
        37th Northwest Film & Video Festival, among others. Her work has
        screened at the Q Film Festival in Jakarta, International Short Film
        Festival Oberhausen in Germany, the Paris GLBT Film Festival, SXSW and
        dozens more. From 2009-2015 she did extensive tours of the U.S. and
        Europe with various live multimedia musical performances, playing drums,
        bass, and singing original work. In addition to showing her own work,
        Wynkoop is a community-minded artist who owns and curates a performance
        space in Olympia known for hosting bands and musicians from all over the
        world; often showcasing artists that fly under-the-radar of even the
        most underground music scenes.

      <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
      <p>
        After a period of experimentation and research into the theory and
        practice of filmmaking, with no formal training, I began making
        completed video works in 1999. One major accomplishment from that time
        is the crux of my larger mission. 9 Weeks is a feature length
        documentary about the punk and activist scene of Olympia, Washington: my
        community. Behind the camera, I had the unique experience of being both
        within and apart from my everyday world, from my peers. This threw my
        own work into relief, and it became a subject unto itself, separate from
        me. The film followed people I know, friends, contemporaries—Carrie
        Brownstein, Calvin Johnson, Nikki McClure, Joe Preston, Mirah, Tae Won
        Yu, Nomy Lamm, Zack Carlson—many of us women, some of us identifying as
        queer, most of us from working class or poor backgrounds, making art
        because of or despite these facts. The film was the culmination of my
        early forays into film; its content a springboard for what was to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 9 Weeks, I continued my self-styled education, and in the process
        found several mentors. Three female filmmakers—Sara Gomez, Agnas Varda,
        Chantal Akerman—loom large in my canon of influence. Their non-linear,
        unusually paced and either oblique or dead-on approaches drive me to
        occupy my own meaningful space in the male dominated medium of film; to
        enter into dialogue with these women and their work. Technique-wise, I
        have referenced the work of Bela Tarr, Yasujiro Ozo, and earlier work of
        Aki Kaurismäki. Similar to these artists, I have made work that allows
        the audience time and space to consider the ideas and images I present
        in my films, as opposed to being bombarded with visual and audio cues
        that explain what is happening in a fixed way. This effect is achieved
        by—but not limited to—deliberate pacing, calculated and sparse use of
        dialogue, grounded camera, and a long depth of field. A static artistic
        vantage creates an active audience, a spectrum of experience where each
        viewer is given the opportunity to follow his or her own internal
        process to develop a personal relationship with the work. Ideally, this
        relationship is one that translates beyond the theater or screening
        room, a connection leading to greater empathy, which can be a powerful
        step towards shifting social consciousness, a goal that emerged
        alongside my process, one that revealed itself through my approach to my
        subject matter as I learned to recognize and hone my own perspectives.

        It was through the work of Rainer Werner Fassbinder that I first
        recognized the power that lies in the union of artistic and social
        values. Of particular resonance is the film Ali: Fear Eats the Soul, the
        story of an interracial relationship born out of the need not only for
        companionship, but for survival, economic and otherwise. As the product
        of a similar marriage, my own identity and place in the world had always
        been difficult to navigate. Despite claims of openness to intersections
        and multi-culturalism within the communities I reside, there is no easy
        place for muddled identities. Ali changed that for me, and I was
        compelled to find and create my own representations of complex
        identities, those who either cannot, or choose not to succumb to the
        status quo—lives in resistance.{' '}

      <p>
        Synthesizing these disparate influences in my filmmaking has taken years
        of artistic exploration and technical research. My daily work includes
        writing treatments, shooting and editing my own movies as well as
        steadily viewing films and reading film-related texts. Whether it’s a
        book on editing, camera operation, film histories, or theory like
        Sculpting In Time by Andrey Tarkovsky, I am constantly engaged in the
        process of filtering and channeling new and old ideas to create
        innovative cinema of populations that are often ignored or made
        one-dimensional by the Hollywood aesthetic.{' '}
